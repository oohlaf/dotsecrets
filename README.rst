DotSecrets
==========

DotSecrets [1]_ is a tool written by Olaf Conradi to facilitate storing
your dotfiles in Git, including those with private information.

By storing your configuration files in a public Git repository, you can
synchronize your settings between multiple devices or share them with
others. Any private information is kept in a single file store outside
the repository. It's up to the user to transport this file between devices.

This tool is similar in functionality to Briefcase [2]_ but differs
significantly. DotSecrets uses Git filtering to manage private information
and uses a different file hierarchy and naming convention.

For more information on the filtering capabilities of Git, see the
git attributes manual [3]_ in section Effects under filter attribute.

Symbolic linking and unlinking is supported by organizing your dotfiles in
topics (specific topic names as top level directory within your repository).
The stow and unstow commands automate linking and unlinking them. You decide
how to name your topics. Either by application or device name, or a
combination of the two. This practise is explained in a blog article [4]_ by
Brandon Invergo back in 2012.


Dependencies
------------

DotSecrets depends on ruamel.yaml [5]_ for reading configuration files and
dploy [6]_ for stow functionality.


Installation
------------

Run::

    $ pip3 install dotsecrets

You should then have a ``dotsecrets`` script available in a new shell.

When installing directly from the Git repository [1]_ use::

    $ pip3 install .

You might need to symlink it into your ``~/bin`` folder::

    $ ln -s ~/.local/bin/dotsecrets ~/bin


Usage
-----

DotSecrets is to be used together with Git to manage your dotfiles.

Git filters are used to clean and smudge secrets. Each filter is configured
using regular expressions grouped per filter name. The filters are named
after the file path relative to the Git root directory.


Filters
-------

Filter rules are defined in a file called ``.dotfilters.yaml`` inside the
dotfiles repository.

Its syntax is as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: 2
    filters:
      "mutt/.mutt/muttrc":
        rules:
          passwd:
            description: Mutt passwords
            numbered: true
            regex: password(\s*)=(\s*)(?#WSUpToHash)
            substitute: password\1=\2(?#Key)
      "irssi/.irssi/config":
        encoding: latin1
        rules:
          nickname:
            description: IRC nickname
            regex: nick(\s*)=(\s*)(?#QuotedString);
            substitute: nick\1=\2"(?#Key)";
          realname:
            regex: real_name(\s*)=(\s*)(?#QuotedString);
            substitute: real_name\1=\2"(?#Key)";

This file contains filter rules for each file that contains secrets. The
first example defines a filter for replacing passwords in mutt configuration
files. A secret is detected by a regular expression matching on each line
containing the word ``password`` followed by an equal sign and each character
(except whitespace) up to an optional hash ``#`` comment.

A match is replaced by the following: ``password = $DotSecrets: password_1$``.
The key is appended with the number of matches because ``numbered`` is defined
as ``true``. This allows for multiple matches and substitutions as long as the
ordering in the file is retained.

The second example shows a filter for hiding your nickname in an Irssi
configuration file. The encoding field will make sure the file is opened
in the specified encoding (default encoding is utf-8). The regular expression
matches any line containing the word nick followed by whitespace and one or
more alphanumeric characters. A match is replaced by
``nick = "$DotSecrets: nickname$";``.

Similar for the filter to hide your real name in the same file. The regular
expression matches any line containing ``real_name`` followed by an equal
sign, quoted text and a final semi-colon. A match is replaced by
``real_name = "$DotSecrets: realname$";``.

Please note that the description, numbered and encoding fields are optional.

The regular expressions and substitutions follow the Python regular expression
syntax [7]_. Substitutions can reference regex groups ``(...)`` using
``\number`` syntax. To make it easier to define complex regular expressions,
the following shortcuts are available. They are defined as regex comments
``(?#...)``:

======================  ====================================================
Shortcut                Description
======================  ====================================================
(?#QuotedString)        Matches balanced single or double quoted strings and
                        is able to cope with escaped quote symbols within
                        the string
(?#QuotedOrSingleWord)  Same as QuotedString or an unquoted single word of
                        non-whitespace characters
(?#WSUpToHash)          Matches whitespace up to the hash symbol ``#``
(?#WSUpToSemicolon)     Matches whitespace up to the semi colon symbol ``;``
(?#Key)                 Used to substitute the secret
======================  ====================================================


Secrets
-------

Secret information, like passwords, answers to security questions, and other
sensitive information is stored in a file called ``dotsecrets.yaml`` inside
the XDG configuration directory (typically
``~/.config/dotsecrets/dotsecrets.yaml``).

Its syntax is as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: 2
    filters:
      "mutt/.mutt/muttrc":
        secrets:
          password_1:
            description: Password for GMail
            secret: s3cr3t
          password_2:
            description: Password for Hotmail
            secret: f00bar
      "irssi/.irssi/config":
        secrets:
          nick:
            secret: mynick
          realname:
            secret: My Real Name

This configuration file contains two filters for mutt and irssi. Each
filter contains one or more secrets. These secrets are used to filter the
files in the Git repository for sensitive data. Each secret has an optional
description field.


Linking filters and secrets
---------------------------

Git attributes are used to link file patterns to Git filters. The filters are
defined in git config files.

Contents of ``.gitattributes``::

    * filter=dotsecrets

When checking in files with Git, the clean command is run for those files that
match the pattern given in ``.gitattributes``. When checking out files that
have a filter defined, the smudge command substitutes the secrets again.

To add these filters run the following commands::

    $ git config filter.dotsecrets.clean "dotsecrets clean %f"
    $ git config filter.dotsecrets.smudge "dotsecrets smudge %f"
    $ git config filter.dotsecrets.required true

They result in the following addition to your ``.git/config`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [filter "dotsecrets"]
        clean = dotsecrets clean %f
        smudge = dotsecrets smudge %f
        required = true

Upon filtering (typically on git checkin, checkout or diff) the ``%f``
argument is replaced by the file path relative to the Git root directory.
This is why filters must be named accordingly.


Initialize Repository
---------------------

Upon a fresh checkout of the dotfiles repository, the git filter and git
attributes configuration are not yet in place. The ``init`` command is
available to initialize the configuration (when needed) and do the initial
smudge on files defined as having secrets.

Example::

    $ git clone git@github.com:username/dotfiles.git
    $ cd dotfiles
    $ dotsecrets init


Stow and Unstow
---------------

Using the stow command each topic is linked into your home directory. The
unstow command will unlink them. The topics to act upon are specified
on the command line. To act on all available topics pass the ``--all``
argument. Add ``--dry-run`` to simulate which actions will be taken
without doing them.

To stow and unstow the current working directory must be set inside the
dotfilters repository.

Example::

    $ dotsecrets stow mutt irssi

This will stow both topics.

Use the following to simulate the actions for linking mutt. The output
is a list of actions needed::

    $ dotsecrets stow --dry-run mutt
    dploy stow: link /home/user/.mutt => dotfiles/mutt/.mutt


To remove the symbolic links from your home directory, run::

    $ dotsecrets unstow --dry-run mutt
    dploy stow: unlink /home/user/.mutt => dotfiles/mutt/.mutt


Adding new dotfiles
-------------------

Defining regular expressions for new filters might require some practise.
To test your filter definitions a ``test`` command is available::

    $ dotsecrets test irssi/.irssi/config
    --- /home/olaf/src/dotfiles/irssi/.irssi/config 2019-07-15 22:40:03.782600150 +0200

Two intermediate files are created: ``config.dotclean`` and
``config.dotsmudge``. The difference is shown between the original source
(which contains secrets) and the cleaned up file (which will contain
markers). Next, the cleaned source is smudged to replace the markers with the
secrets from your secrets store. The resulting file should be identical to
the original source file. If that is not the case, the difference is shown.

Suppose a typo was made in the secrets store::

In the example above, key nick was set to myname not mynick in the secrets
store. When the execution finishes, the intermediate files are deleted. If
you want to retain those files for closer inspection, specify the ``--keep``
flag on the command line.

When you are satisfied with the output you can add the original source under
version control. The clean filter will be applied before the commit.
